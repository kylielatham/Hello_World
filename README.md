## Hello_World

### Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a first year graduate student in the University of Iowa's Master of Business Analytics program, graduating in December of 2022. I am interested in business analytics, specifically for the purpose of business consulting. I am excited to add the projects I am working on to my GitHub as my skills develop!
